## Introduction

There are 2 types of PowerShell versions which can be present in a system. `version 5.x` - Example: `5.1.22621.2506` which we call it as `Windows PowerShell` or `PowerShell Desktop Edition` and other is `version 7.x and above` and we call it as `PowerShell Core` - Example: `7.4.0` which can be run on Windows/Linux/Mac OS machines (platform independent).
