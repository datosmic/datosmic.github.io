## Hi, This is Raviüëã

I'm an **IT Professional** and **Data Science Enthusiast** with over **7 years** of hands-on experience architecting and delivering intelligent solutions across the **Microsoft technology ecosystem**. From **Power Automate workflows** to **Azure integrations**, **SharePoint customizations** to **Power BI dashboards**, I thrive on transforming business challenges into streamlined, data-driven outcomes.

My journey spans **leading cross-functional teams**, **collaborating with stakeholders**, and publishing **IoT-driven innovations** in international journals. I specialize in **automating routine tasks**, **optimizing reporting systems**, and **enhancing productivity** through the **Power Platform** and Microsoft applications ‚Äî always with a focus on clarity, efficiency, and impact.

üîç Whether it's scripting with **PowerShell**, querying vast datasets with **Kusto (KQL)**, or visualizing insights that drive decisions, I bring a deep curiosity and a commitment to **continuous learning**. I believe technology should empower people ‚Äî and I love building solutions that do just that.

Welcome to my digital space **_DatOsmic_** (Unraveling the cosmic patterns of data), where I share **ideas**, **experiments**, and **reflections** from the intersection of **tech and transformation**.
